# Customer-Churn-Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify patterns and factors influencing churn and provide actionable insights to reduce customer turnover.

Key Features:
*Data Preprocessing*: Includes feature engineering, handling missing values, standardization, and encoding categorical variables.

*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Uncovered patterns in customer churn, including gender and service preferences, through visualizations.

*Machine Learning Models*: Implemented a variety of algorithms, such as:
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Logistic Regression
XGBoost and CatBoost

*Model Evaluation*: Assessed model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curves.
